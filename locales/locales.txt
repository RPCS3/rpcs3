Folder: /trunk/locales
Contains: PO files for gettext language translations


The PO files in this folder are the most current/up-to-date translations for any given revision
of PCSX2.  When checking out trunk, for example, these files are usually chasing a "moving
target" that may have a number of language string changes from PO file contents.  When checking
out a stable release branch (such as 0.9.8) the PO files should be fairly stable and unchanging.

In general it is recommended that translators focus time on perfecting stable releases, and
contribute to trunk/dev-branch languages only if you're feeling eagar, or if PCSX2 devs have
announced a scheduled stable release in the future (ie, requested translators to update and
submit new PO files).
