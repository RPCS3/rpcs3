/*
 * When compiling C and C++ code using SDK header files, the development
 * environment can specify a target platform by #define-ing the
 * pre-processor symbol WINAPI_FAMILY to one of the following values.
 * Each FAMILY value denotes an application family for which a different
 * subset of the total set of header-file-defined APIs are available.
 * Setting the WINAPI_FAMILY value will effectively hide from the
 * editing and compilation environments the existence of APIs that
 * are not applicable to the family of applications targeting a
 * specific platform.
 */

/* In Windows 10, WINAPI_PARTITIONs will be used to add additional  
 * device specific APIs to a particular WINAPI_FAMILY.  
 * For example, when writing Windows Universal apps, specifying 
 * WINAPI_FAMILY_APP will hide phone APIs from compilation.  
 * However, specifying WINAPI_PARTITION_PHONE_APP=1 additionally, will         
 * unhide any API hidden behind the partition, to the compiler.

 * The following partitions are currently defined:
 * WINAPI_PARTITION_DESKTOP            // usable for Desktop Win32 apps (but not store apps)
 * WINAPI_PARTITION_APP                // usable for Windows Universal store apps
 * WINAPI_PARTITION_PC_APP             // specific to Desktop-only store apps
 * WINAPI_PARTITION_PHONE_APP          // specific to Phone-only store apps
 * WINAPI_PARTITION_SYSTEM             // specific to System applications
 * WINAPI_PARTITION_SERVER             // specific to Server applications
*/

/*
 * The WINAPI_FAMILY values of 0 and 1 are reserved to ensure that
 * an error will occur if WINAPI_FAMILY is set to any
 * WINAPI_PARTITION value (which must be 0 or 1, see below).

 * WINAPI_FAMILY_PARTITION(...).

 * a sequence of declarations that are part of both the Windows Desktop
