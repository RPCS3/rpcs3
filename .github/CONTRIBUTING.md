# Getting Started

Before getting started using the emulator, read the [Quickstart Guide](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart). After reading it, if you need support, check out [How to ask for Support](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/wiki/How-to-ask-for-Support).

# Issue Reporting

**The GitHub Issue Tracker is not the place to ask for support or to submit [Game Compatibility](https://rpcs3.net/compatibility) reports.** Requests for support or incorrect reports will be closed. If you are not sure whether the issue you want to report is an actual issue that is not yet known, please use the forums to submit such report.

**Before reporting an issue:**
- Check if your system matches all the minimum requirements listed in the [Quickstart Guide](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart);
- Search older issues/forum threads to see if your issue was already submitted;
- Use understandable English. It doesn't need to be perfect, but clear enough to understand your message;
- While reporting issues, please follow the template for the type of issue you've selected (Regression Report, Bug Report or Feature Request), which is prefilled on the issue's textbox.

Submitting your test results for Commercial Games must be done on our forums. Please read the [Game Compatibility](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/wiki/Game-Compatibility) wiki page before doing so.
