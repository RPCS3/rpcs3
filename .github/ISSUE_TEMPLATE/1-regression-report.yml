        # Identify the regressed build
        Please provide the _exact_ build (or commit) information that introduced the regression you're reporting.
        * Please see [How to find the build that caused a regression](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Using_different_versions_of_RPCS3#How_to_find_the_build_that_caused_a_regression.3F) in our wiki.
        * You can find [History of RPCS3 builds](https://rpcs3.net/compatibility?b) here.
        
        Make sure you're running with settings as close to default as possible 
        * **Do NOT enable any emulator game patches when reporting issues**
        * Only change settings that are required for the game to work

        Obtaining the log file:
        * Run the game until you find the regression.
        * Completely close RPCS3 and locate the log file.
        
        RPCS3's Log file will be ```RPCS3.log.gz``` (sometimes shows as RPCS3.log with zip icon) or ```RPCS3.log``` (sometimes shows as RPCS3 wtih notepad icon).
        * On Windows it will be in the RPCS3 directory near the executable
        * On Linux it will be in ```~/.cache/rpcs3/```
        * On MacOS it will be in ```~/Library/Caches/rpcs3```. If you're unable to locate it copy paste the path in Spotlight and hit enter.
