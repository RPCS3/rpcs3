## Quick summary
Please describe what exactly has stopped working correctly

## Details
Please provide _exact_ build (or commit) information that introduced the regression you're reporting.
Please see How to find the build that caused a regression in wiki: https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Using_different_versions_of_RPCS3#How_to_find_the_build_that_caused_a_regression.3F
You can find old builds here: https://rpcs3.net/compatibility?b

Please remember to attach TWO logs: one for the build that exhibits regression, and one for the previous build that works as expected.

If the regression caused a graphical issue, please provide RSX capture and a Renderdoc capture that demonstrate the issue.
To create an RSX capture, enable Debugger view (View → Show Debugger) and use the RSX Capture button. Captues will be stored in RPCS3 folder → captures.
To create Renderdoc capture, please refer to Renderdoc documentation https://renderdoc.org/docs/how/how_capture_frame.html
