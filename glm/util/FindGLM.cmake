# FindGLM - attempts to locate the glm matrix/vector library.
#
# This module defines the following variables (on success):
#   GLM_INCLUDE_DIRS  - where to find glm/glm.hpp
#   GLM_FOUND         - if the library was successfully located
#
# It is trying a few standard installation locations, but can be customized
# with the following variables:
#   GLM_ROOT_DIR      - root directory of a glm installation
#                       Headers are expected to be found in either:
#                       <GLM_ROOT_DIR>/glm/glm.hpp           OR
#                       <GLM_ROOT_DIR>/include/glm/glm.hpp
#                       This variable can either be a cmake or environment
#                       variable. Note however that changing the value
#                       of the environment varible will NOT result in
#                       re-running the header search and therefore NOT
#                       adjust the variables set by this module.
