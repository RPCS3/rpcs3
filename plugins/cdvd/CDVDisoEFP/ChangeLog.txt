       Note: only ISO and CDDA seem to be readable from CDs at this time.
         If your trying to get another format, use Linux.
         DVD5 is readable. Don't have a DVD9 game to test. (I think - efp)

 * Added Table Rebuild (for those who lost .table files.) (efp)
 * Put in a separate source program to compare two ISOs for data accuracy. (efp)
 * Renamed executables and config files (so not to conflict with CDVDiso) (efp)
