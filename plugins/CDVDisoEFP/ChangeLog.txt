CDVDisoEFP v0.6 Changes:
--------------------

 v0.6:
 * Completely re-wrote screens (efp)
 * Used device access sources from CDVDlinuz to get data from DVDs. (efp)
 *   Added ability to read devices from Windows XP (efp)
       Note: only ISO and CDDA seem to be readable from CDs at this time.
         If your trying to get another format, use Linux.
         DVD5 is readable. Don't have a DVD9 game to test. (I think - efp) 
 * Separated image file access by OS. (Linux, Windows) (efp)
 * Separated Multi-file/Compression/Image-Typing to their own source files. (efp)
 * Added a few entries to the Image Typing database, based on Linux CD-ROM sources (efp)
 * Added Table Rebuild (for those who lost .table files.) (efp)
 * Put in a separate source program to compare two ISOs for data accuracy. (efp)
 * Renamed executables and config files (so not to conflict with CDVDiso) (efp)
 * Internalized the .INI File code (to allow use in other OS-es besides Windows) (efp)
 * Added temporarily a .toc file saving track info (for PS1 and Music CDs) (efp)
 * Added a new compression format. (BZip2 Size) (efp)
 * Added .glade files at linuzappz's request (efp)
 * Upgraded to 0.6.0 beta PS2Edef.h definitions (efp)

 * Data buffer start position re-set for CDs. (shadow caught the problem while testing)
 * Supported images grouped in "Browse" button (shadow's suggestion)
 * Initial Image reminder added to Windows CDVDOpen() (shadow's suggestion)
 * used 64 bit fstat (fstat64) for correct sizes on >2GB files in Linux (efp)
 * Adjusted CD types to allow for PS2 CDs (shadow pointed out an example iso)
 * Added changing CDs/DVDs while emulation stopped (shadow's suggestion)
     Built in an "open tray" delay when switching media. (efp)
 * Added ".img" to Image Filter (although .cue/.sub files aren't tapped.) (efp)
 * Added ".nrg" to Image Filter (shadow's suggestion)
 * In Windows, when newly selected from the PCSX2 configure screen, CDVDinit()
     (as well as InitConf()) are not called. Fixed (EFP)

 * Added block dumping code
 * Added BZ2/Z2 format ;)
