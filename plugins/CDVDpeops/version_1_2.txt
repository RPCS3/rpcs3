25. December, 2004   Version 1.2

- The plugin is tested with PCSX2 0.7!

- I've repaired a stupid bug concerning calculating the track sizes.

- I've added an hack for big DVDs (fake minute info in the CDVDgetTD
  function).

29. March, 2004   Version 1.1

- Ah, to make it short: I've got some times this weekend, tried the 
  PCSX2 0.6 version, noticed that my relatively new Plextor PX-708A 
  drive didn't work with the P.E.Op.S. dvd plugin, and therefore 
  added a new good working reading mode. 

  So, if you had just some error message like 'unable to open dvd 
  plugin' with PCSX2 and the P.E.Op.S. dvd plugin in the past, chances 
  are high that this version will now give better results on your 
  system. At least I was able to see the first intro screens of some 
  games without problems :)

19. November, 2003   Version 1.0

- What to say? Blame Shadow of the PCSX2 team... he wanted
  a PS2 CDVD plugin from me, and he didn't give up asking until
  I made one, sigh ;)

  Ok, I have done this plugin using my old P.E.Op.S. PSX cdr
  plugin sources, so you will notice some similaries, of course.

  This plugin is able to play PS2 CDs and PS2 DVDs in your
  PC's CD/DVD drives, and since all the old P.E.Op.S. cdr read
  caching modes are available, the speed should be fine as well.

  For the plugin settings, check out the included readme file
  (but if you are familar with the P.E.Op.S. cdr config, you
  will not have much troubles... the new plugin's config is even 
  easier to use, since you don't have to specify a read method).

  I cannot say much about compatibility (since I did the plugin
  in a few hours last weekend, and I only have a Liteon DVD drive
  for tests available right now), but I think it's free of major
  bugs, so feel free to try it.

  Some stuff is not available right now: PPF support and subchannel
  reading, for example (but both are not very important at the 
  moment, imho). 

  The sources of the plugin (license: GPL) can be found on the 
  P.E.Op.S. site on sourceforge, I've added a MS VisualStudio 6 
  project file, as well as a Bloodshed Dev-C++ one (you will 
  also need NASM for this one).

  Ok, have fun :)
