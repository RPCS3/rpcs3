 Translating PCSX2
 -----------------

Just some small notes for translators.

First download the translator package from the download section of http://www.pcsx2.net

PCSX2 translations are based on the gettext library:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext.

The main file to translate is pcsx2.po which cames in the package you downloaded, 
note that you must place the translated
strings over the msgstr and leave untouched the msgid.

Example:

msgid "Memory Card 1"
msgstr "Your Translation goes here"

To test the translation use the msgfmt.exe utility to
convert the translated pcsx2.po file to a pcsx2.mo file
with this command: 'msgfmt pcsx2.po -o pcsx2.mo -v', after translating
the file please send us the .po and .mo file and please ask before
translating it, maybe someone has already started it 
for your language.

Version update for 0.9.2/3:

I have rewritten the contents of the Translation doc to ease reading
and brung it up to date with the current GUI. Translations will work in 0.9.2
but some Menu options may still show as their original names (fixed in 0.9.3).

help you.
