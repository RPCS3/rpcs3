				thanks to fumofumo on irc.

			[-] The previous DVD/CD change by ref was just a hack, so i commited the old
				version again
			[-] I've commented out RECOMPILE_VUMI_LOADSTORE on sVU_Micro.h, instead
				of commenting it out in iVU1micro.c as ref did on last update, 
				that way is better until i fix the real problem
			[*] Improved vuDIV for .x to .x cases
			[+] Added PEXTRW/PINSRW
			    (linuzappz)

 * 05/08/05:[-] Fixed a couple of VU-Rec ops, swapped some over to the interpreter to fix 2d

			    (refraction)

			[-] Vsync speeds shouldnt be as insane as they were, the target was set as 1/4 the rate
				instead of 1/2!
			[!] 32bit timer interrupt checks arent working properly eg. overflow only works
				when checking if they are equal, on target only works on overflow :/ but the checking
				method which was used in SafeIOP is more accurate.

			[-] Removed Pointless While loops on GIF & SPR, also fixed condition where SPR0
				couldn't use destination chain mode
			[!] Gating on the IOP needs checking/completing, i have no docs on it so
				i can't check the values for it, they seem different to EE :/
			[-] Removed GS Stall checking on GIF, could have caused it not to send data.
			[*] Added code for faster V4-32 unpacks when CL == WL
			[*] x86 code kept in int format for rec instead of U8 to INT conversion (GiGaHeRz)

			[!] I'll start commenting more the code from now on, so it'll
				be easier for us to understand every part of pcsx2, others
				pls do the same kthx
				(Refraction-linuzappz)

 * 14/10/03:[*] Modified the memRead functions, now they're better for tlbs
                misses, but note that they have one more arg, so gold, you'll
                have to update the rec
                (linuzappz)

 * 12/10/03:[*] Removed the new module in cvs called GoldRec. Now GoldRec is a directory under ix86-32.
                (GoldFinger)

 * 10/10/03:[*] Removed the new recompiler from the main project and removed its dependencies, now there

 * 01/10/03:[+] Handle for the EDI flag at ERET, a guess actually ;)
                (linuzappz)

 * 30/09/03:[*] Reg caching works with bios and almost everything as normal rec does, need to
                check better what does not work.
            [*] Splitted iR5900.c into several .c files for easy navigation and for sanity
                purposes as iR5900.c was HUGE.
            [-] Fix LOTS of reg caching bugs, the main one was the comparission of 64bits registers.
                (GoldFinger)
            
 * 30/09/03:[*] Added a base interrupt delay for the dma7 (spu2)

                (linuzappz)

                added a #pragma to disable optimization just to that function and everything
                is working again as it should (linuz, please check if this pragma will interfere
                with linux)
            [*] The win32 project is back like before, the new Recompiler project was removed and
                everything is working.
                (GoldFinger)

					 (Florin)

 * 25/09/03:[*] Modified the project structure under win32, I separated the recompiler from
                the main project into a static lib, so now I can work with two projects instead
                of one and enable optimizations. Now register caching works much better as I 
                enable speed optimizations in the Recompiler project but had to disable it in
                the main project, the real problem is the global optimizations, this way I am 
                proving that the problem is not on my code... :)
            [-] Fix lots of reg caching bugs and commented some of the reg caching instructions
                that are buggy. Lots of demos work now, P51, colors, colors15 and maybe some others.

                (linuzappz)

 * 23/09/03:[*] Splitted the bios files so the code is the .c files and not on the .h files
            [-] Fixed several bugs in reg caching and improved the routines
            [!] Visual Studio .NET (dont know the others) speed optimizations are
                messing with the code so it is recommended to build release mode
                without Speed optimizations
                (GoldFinger)

 * 23/09/03:[-] Commented the Syms in BiosInit.h, since they are only
