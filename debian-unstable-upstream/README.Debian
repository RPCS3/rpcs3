Package information for PCSX2
------------------------------

 * The reasons given by upstream as to why they remove -fPIC are the following:
   - Code only supports the i386 architecture.
   - Code uses the ebx register and this is not compliant with -fPIC.
   - The use of -fPIC negatively impacts the performance of the program.
   - The .so file are not shared libraries but plug-ins. No program should try
     to link with them.

Information about the plug-ins for video
------------------------------------------

 * The zzogl plug-in comes in two flavors:
   - The Nvidia Cg version which requires the non-free nvidia-cg-toolkit
     package. Since this package contains GPL-2+ code this plug-in can't be
     distributed without an GPL exception allowing linking with non-free
     libraries. If the user desires to try this flavor of the plug-in he/she
     must:
     + Install the nvidia-cg-dev or nvidia-cg-toolkit package from non-free.
     + Pass "-DGLSL_API=FALSE" to dh_auto_configure in the rules file.
     + Add "usr/lib/*/games/pcsx2/*.dat /usr/share/games/pcsx2/" to the install
       file.
     + Compile the program using dpkg-buildpackage.
     This plug-in currently provides the greatest compatibility with video cards
     and drivers. It currently works with open source drivers like radeon R600.
   - The OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) version which currently only works with
     AMD video cards but support for other cards is being worked on.

 * The GSdx plug-in currently only supports the OpenGL software renderer.

 * The GSdx and zzogl GLSL plug-ins currently require a video card that supports
   at least OpenGL 3.0. A noninclusive list of cards that support OpenGL 3.0 is:
   - Radeon HD series (except HD2300)
   - GeForce 8, 9, 100-series, 200-series, 300-series, 400-series and 500-series
   - Intel Sandy Bridge HD Graphics 2000 and up

 * Currently the proprietary drivers for AMD and Nvidia have support for
   OpenGL 3.0 and above. The GSdx and/or zzogl GLSL plug-ins use the following
   extensions/commands that may or may not be completely implemented in the
   open source video stack:
   - OpenGL 3.0 (supported on Mesa 9.2)
     + glClearBuffer
     + glGetStringi
     + glVertexAttribI
     + GLX_ARB_create_context
     + GL_ARB_vertex_array_object
     + GL_ARB_framebuffer_object
   - OpenGL 3.1 (supported on Mesa 9.2)
     + GL_ARB_texture_rectangle (zzogl)
     + GL_ARB_uniform_buffer_object
   - OpenGL 3.2
     + GL_ARB_geometry_shader4
     + GL_ARB_draw_elements_base_vertex (GSdx)
     + GLX_ARB_create_context_profile
     + GLSL 150
   - OpenGL 3.3 (supported on Mesa 9.2)
     + GL_ARB_blend_func_extended (GSdx)
     + GL_ARB_explicit_attrib_location
     + GL_ARB_sampler_objects (GSdx)
   - OpenGL 4.0
     + GL_ARB_GPU_shader5 (GSdx, improve FXAA, optional)
   - OpenGL 4.1
     + GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects
   - OpenGL 4.2
     + GL_ARB_map_buffer_alignment
     + GL_ARB_shading_language_420pack
     + GL_ARB_texture_storage
   - OpenGL 4.3
     + GL_ARB_copy_image (GSdx, optional)
