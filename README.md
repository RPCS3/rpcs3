* CMake 3.8.2+
* Debian & Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libopenal-dev libglew-dev zlib1g-dev libedit-dev libvulkan-dev libudev-dev git qt5-default libevdev-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qtbase5-private-dev`
* Arch: `sudo pacman -S glew openal cmake vulkan-validation-layers qt5-base qt5-declarative`
* Fedora: `sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel cmake glew glew-devel libatomic libevdev-devel libudev-devel openal-devel qt5-devel vulkan-devel`

**If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you may need to install the libglvnd package.**


## Building

Only Windows and Linux are officially supported for building. However, various other platforms are capable of building RPCS3. Other instructions may be found [here](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Building).

Clone and initialize the repository:

1) `git clone https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3.git`
2) `cd rpcs3/`
3) `git submodule update --init`

### Windows
#### Configuring the Qt plugin (if used)

1) Go to the Qt5 menu and edit Qt5 options.
2) Add the path to your Qt installation with compiler e.g. `<QtInstallFolder>\5.11.2\msvc2017_64`.
3) While selecting the rpcs3qt project, go to Qt5->Project Setting and select the version you added.

#### Building the projects

Open `rpcs3.sln`. The recommended build configuration is `Release - LLVM` for all purposes.

You may want to download precompiled [LLVM libs](https://github.com/RPCS3/llvm/releases/download/continuous-master/llvmlibs.7z) and extract to root rpcs3 folder (which contains `rpcs3.sln`), as well as download and extract [additional libs](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1A2eOMmCO714i0U7J0qI4aEMKnuWl8l_R) to `lib\%CONFIGURATION%-x64\` to speed up compilation time (unoptimised/debug libs are currently not available precompiled).

If you're not using precompiled libs, build the projects in *__BUILD_BEFORE* folder: right-click on every project > *Build*.


`Build > Build Solution`


### Linux

While still in the project root:

1) `cd .. && mkdir rpcs3_build && cd rpcs3_build`
2) `cmake ../rpcs3/ && make`
3) Run RPCS3 with `./bin/rpcs3`

When using GDB, configure it to ignore SIGSEGV signal (`handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint`).
If desired, use the various build options in [CMakeLists](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt).
