   * The following guarded test is specifically for statically

   * Note that by not providing this synchronisation we risk
   * introducing race conditions into applications which are
   * correctly written.
   *
   * Approach
   * --------
   * We know that static condition variables will not be PROCESS_SHARED
   * so we can serialise access to internal state using
   * Win32 Critical Sections rather than Win32 Mutexes.
   *
   * If using a single global lock slows applications down too much,
   * multiple global locks could be created and hashed on some random
   * value associated with each mutex, the pointer perhaps. At a guess,
   * a good value for the optimal number of global locks might be
   * the number of processors + 1.
