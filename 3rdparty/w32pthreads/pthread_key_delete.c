      * ------------------------------------------------------
      * DOCPUBLIC
      *      This function deletes a thread-specific data key. This
      *      does not change the value of the thread specific data key
      *      for any thread and does not run the key's destructor
      *      in any thread so it should be used with caution.
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      key
      *              pointer to an instance of pthread_key_t
      *
      *
      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function deletes a thread-specific data key. This
      *      does not change the value of the thread specific data key
      *      for any thread and does not run the key's destructor
      *      in any thread so it should be used with caution.
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               successfully deleted the key,
      *              EINVAL          key is invalid,
