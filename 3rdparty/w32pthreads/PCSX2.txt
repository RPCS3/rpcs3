-- Air's Notes on Using PThreads --
-----------------------------------

The official name of the DLL is "w32pthreads.dll" -- I use the prefix to indicate with
some vaugeness that the pthreads dll is a modified non-standard implementation (see below
for details); just in case pthreads-win32 dlls in another universe were to be conflicting
interests.

I created a subfolder for pthreads' publically exposed header files, since "config.h" was
rather brutal include file namespace pollution. >_<

Important: pthread_cond is an inherently flawed concept, and is quite incredibly slow
on top of it.  It's primarily meant for inter-process thread regulation, of which we 
do none.  Therefore it has been excluded from the library builds.  Don't use it!

I've also disabled rwlocks, since they use pthread_cond internally.  Again, there should
be little or no reason to have to use those within the context of a high performance app
like Pcsx2.
