       3 output uncompressed streams (MAIN, CALL, JUMP) were flushed.

     write branch marker (e8/e8/0f8x) in one call of Bcj2Enc_Encode(),
     and it could calculate symbol for RC in another call of Bcj2Enc_Encode().
     BCJ2 encoder uses ip/fileIp/fileSize/relatLimit values to calculate RC symbol.
     And these CBcj2Enc variables can have different values in different Bcj2Enc_Encode() calls.
     So caller must finish each block with BCJ2_ENC_FINISH_MODE_END_BLOCK
     to ensure that RC symbol is calculated and written in proper block.

    before v23: we used 32-bit variables and (mod 4 GiB) conversion
    since  v23: we use  64-bit variables and (signed Int32 offset) conversion.
  The absolute address condition for conversion in v23:

  note that if (fileSize64 > 2 GiB). there is difference between
  old (mod 4 GiB) way (v22) and new (signed Int32 offset) way (v23).
