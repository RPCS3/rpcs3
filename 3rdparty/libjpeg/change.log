CHANGE LOG for Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software


Version 7  27-Jun-2009
----------------------

New scaled DCTs implemented.
djpeg now supports scalings N/8 with all N from 1 to 16.
cjpeg now supports scalings 8/N with all N from 1 to 16.
Scaled DCTs with size larger than 8 are now also used for resolving the
common 2x2 chroma subsampling case without additional spatial resampling.
Separate spatial resampling for those kind of files is now only necessary
for N>8 scaling cases.
Furthermore, separate scaled DCT functions are provided for direct resolving
of the common asymmetric subsampling cases (2x1 and 1x2) without additional
spatial resampling.

cjpeg -quality option has been extended for support of separate quality
settings for luminance and chrominance (or in general, for every provided
quantization table slot).
New API function jpeg_default_qtables() and q_scale_factor array in library.

Added -nosmooth option to cjpeg, complementary to djpeg.
New variable "do_fancy_downsampling" in library, complement to fancy
upsampling.  Fancy upsampling now uses direct DCT scaling with sizes
larger than 8.  The old method is not reversible and has been removed.

Support arithmetic entropy encoding and decoding.
Added files jaricom.c, jcarith.c, jdarith.c.

Straighten the file structure:
Removed files jidctred.c, jcphuff.c, jchuff.h, jdphuff.c, jdhuff.h.

jpegtran has a new "lossless" cropping feature.

Implement -perfect option in jpegtran, new API function
jtransform_perfect_transform() in transupp. (DP 204_perfect.dpatch)

Better error messages for jpegtran fopen failure.
(DP 203_jpegtran_errmsg.dpatch)

Fix byte order issue with 16bit PPM/PGM files in rdppm.c/wrppm.c:
according to Netpbm, the de facto standard implementation of the PNM formats,
the most significant byte is first. (DP 203_rdppm.dpatch)

Add -raw option to rdjpgcom not to mangle the output.
(DP 205_rdjpgcom_raw.dpatch)

Make rdjpgcom locale aware. (DP 201_rdjpgcom_locale.dpatch)

Add extern "C" to jpeglib.h.
This avoids the need to put extern "C" { ... } around #include "jpeglib.h"
in your C++ application.  Defining the symbol DONT_USE_EXTERN_C in the
configuration prevents this. (DP 202_jpeglib.h_c++.dpatch)


Version 6b  27-Mar-1998
-----------------------

jpegtran has new features for lossless image transformations (rotation
and flipping) as well as "lossless" reduction to grayscale.

jpegtran now copies comments by default; it has a -copy switch to enable
copying all APPn blocks as well, or to suppress comments.  (Formerly it
always suppressed comments and APPn blocks.)  jpegtran now also preserves
JFIF version and resolution information.

New decompressor library feature: COM and APPn markers found in the input
file can be saved in memory for later use by the application.  (Before,
you had to code this up yourself with a custom marker processor.)

There is an unused field "void * client_data" now in compress and decompress
parameter structs; this may be useful in some applications.

JFIF version number information is now saved by the decoder and accepted by
the encoder.  jpegtran uses this to copy the source file's version number,
to ensure "jpegtran -copy all" won't create bogus files that contain JFXX
extensions but claim to be version 1.01.  Applications that generate their
own JFXX extension markers also (finally) have a supported way to cause the
encoder to emit JFIF version number 1.02.

djpeg's trace mode reports JFIF 1.02 thumbnail images as such, rather
than as unknown APP0 markers.

In -verbose mode, djpeg and rdjpgcom will try to print the contents of
APP12 markers as text.  Some digital cameras store useful text information
in APP12 markers.

Handling of truncated data streams is more robust: blocks beyond the one in
which the error occurs will be output as uniform gray, or left unchanged
if decoding a progressive JPEG.  The appearance no longer depends on the
Huffman tables being used.

Huffman tables are checked for validity much more carefully than before.

To avoid the Unisys LZW patent, djpeg's GIF output capability has been
changed to produce "uncompressed GIFs", and cjpeg's GIF input capability
has been removed altogether.  We're not happy about it either, but there
seems to be no good alternative.

The configure script now supports building libjpeg as a shared library
on many flavors of Unix (all the ones that GNU libtool knows how to
build shared libraries for).  Use "./configure --enable-shared" to
try this out.

New jconfig file and makefiles for Microsoft Visual C++ and Developer Studio.
Also, a jconfig file and a build script for Metrowerks CodeWarrior
on Apple Macintosh.  makefile.dj has been updated for DJGPP v2, and there
are miscellaneous other minor improvements in the makefiles.

jmemmac.c now knows how to create temporary files following Mac System 7
conventions.

djpeg's -map switch is now able to read raw-format PPM files reliably.

cjpeg -progressive -restart no longer generates any unnecessary DRI markers.

Multiple calls to jpeg_simple_progression for a single JPEG object
no longer leak memory.


Version 6a  7-Feb-96
--------------------

Library initialization sequence modified to detect version mismatches
and struct field packing mismatches between library and calling application.
This change requires applications to be recompiled, but does not require
any application source code change.

All routine declarations changed to the style "GLOBAL(type) name ...",
that is, GLOBAL, LOCAL, METHODDEF, EXTERN are now macros taking the
routine's return type as an argument.  This makes it possible to add
Microsoft-style linkage keywords to all the routines by changing just
these macros.  Note that any application code that was using these macros
will have to be changed.

DCT coefficient quantization tables are now stored in normal array order
rather than zigzag order.  Application code that calls jpeg_add_quant_table,
or otherwise manipulates quantization tables directly, will need to be
changed.  If you need to make such code work with either older or newer
versions of the library, a test like "#if JPEG_LIB_VERSION >= 61" is
recommended.

djpeg's trace capability now dumps DQT tables in natural order, not zigzag
order.  This allows the trace output to be made into a "-qtables" file
more easily.

New system-dependent memory manager module for use on Apple Macintosh.

Fix bug in cjpeg's -smooth option: last one or two scanlines would be
duplicates of the prior line unless the image height mod 16 was 1 or 2.

Repair minor problems in VMS, BCC, MC6 makefiles.

New configure script based on latest GNU Autoconf.

Correct the list of include files needed by MetroWerks C for ccommand().

Numerous small documentation updates.


Version 6  2-Aug-95
-------------------

Progressive JPEG support: library can read and write full progressive JPEG
files.  A "buffered image" mode supports incremental decoding for on-the-fly
display of progressive images.  Simply recompiling an existing IJG-v5-based
decoder with v6 should allow it to read progressive files, though of course
without any special progressive display.

New "jpegtran" application performs lossless transcoding between different
JPEG formats; primarily, it can be used to convert baseline to progressive
JPEG and vice versa.  In support of jpegtran, the library now allows lossless
reading and writing of JPEG files as DCT coefficient arrays.  This ability
may be of use in other applications.

Notes for programmers:
* We changed jpeg_start_decompress() to be able to suspend; this makes all
decoding modes available to suspending-input applications.  However,
existing applications that use suspending input will need to be changed
to check the return value from jpeg_start_decompress().  You don't need to
do anything if you don't use a suspending data source.
* We changed the interface to the virtual array routines: access_virt_array
routines now take a count of the number of rows to access this time.  The
last parameter to request_virt_array routines is now interpreted as the
maximum number of rows that may be accessed at once, but not necessarily
the height of every access.


Version 5b  15-Mar-95
---------------------

Correct bugs with grayscale images having v_samp_factor > 1.

jpeg_write_raw_data() now supports output suspension.

Correct bugs in "configure" script for case of compiling in
a directory other than the one containing the source files.

Repair bug in jquant1.c: sometimes didn't use as many colors as it could.

Borland C makefile and jconfig file work under either MS-DOS or OS/2.

Miscellaneous improvements to documentation.


Version 5a  7-Dec-94
--------------------

Changed color conversion roundoff behavior so that grayscale values are
represented exactly.  (This causes test image files to change.)

Make ordered dither use 16x16 instead of 4x4 pattern for a small quality
improvement.

New configure script based on latest GNU Autoconf.
Fix configure script to handle CFLAGS correctly.
Rename *.auto files to *.cfg, so that configure script still works if
file names have been truncated for DOS.

Fix bug in rdbmp.c: didn't allow for extra data between header and image.

Modify rdppm.c/wrppm.c to handle 2-byte raw PPM/PGM formats for 12-bit data.

Fix several bugs in rdrle.c.

NEED_SHORT_EXTERNAL_NAMES option was broken.

Revise jerror.h/jerror.c for more flexibility in message table.

Repair oversight in jmemname.c NO_MKTEMP case: file could be there
but unreadable.


Version 5  24-Sep-94
--------------------

Version 5 represents a nearly complete redesign and rewrite of the IJG
software.  Major user-visible changes include:
  * Automatic configuration simplifies installation for most Unix systems.
  * A range of speed vs. image quality tradeoffs are supported.
    This includes resizing of an image during decompression: scaling down
    by a factor of 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8 is handled very efficiently.
  * New programs rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom allow insertion and extraction
    of text comments in a JPEG file.

The application programmer's interface to the library has changed completely.
Notable improvements include:
  * We have eliminated the use of callback routines for handling the
    uncompressed image data.  The application now sees the library as a
    set of routines that it calls to read or write image data on a
    scanline-by-scanline basis.
  * The application image data is represented in a conventional interleaved-
    pixel format, rather than as a separate array for each color channel.
    This can save a copying step in many programs.
  * The handling of compressed data has been cleaned up: the application can
    supply routines to source or sink the compressed data.  It is possible to
    suspend processing on source/sink buffer overrun, although this is not
    supported in all operating modes.
  * All static state has been eliminated from the library, so that multiple
    instances of compression or decompression can be active concurrently.
  * JPEG abbreviated datastream formats are supported, ie, quantization and
    Huffman tables can be stored separately from the image data.
  * And not only that, but the documentation of the library has improved
    considerably!


The last widely used release before the version 5 rewrite was version 4A of
18-Feb-93.  Change logs before that point have been discarded, since they
are not of much interest after the rewrite.
