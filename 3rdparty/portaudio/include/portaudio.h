/**
 Functions of type PaStreamCallback are implemented by PortAudio clients.
 They consume, process or generate audio in response to requests from an
 active PortAudio stream.

 When a stream is running, PortAudio calls the stream callback periodically.
 The callback function is responsible for processing buffers of audio samples 
 passed via the input and output parameters.

 The PortAudio stream callback runs at very high or real-time priority.
 It is required to consistently meet its time deadlines. Do not allocate 
 memory, access the file system, call library functions or call other functions 
 from the stream callback that may block or take an unpredictable amount of
 time to complete.

 In order for a stream to maintain glitch-free operation the callback
 must consume and return audio data faster than it is recorded and/or
 played. PortAudio anticipates that each callback invocation may execute for 
 a duration approaching the duration of frameCount audio frames at the stream 
 sample rate. It is reasonable to expect to be able to utilise 70% or more of
 the available CPU time in the PortAudio callback. However, due to buffer size 
 adaption and other factors, not all host APIs are able to guarantee audio 
 stability under heavy CPU load with arbitrary fixed callback buffer sizes. 
 When high callback CPU utilisation is required the most robust behavior 
 can be achieved by using paFramesPerBufferUnspecified as the 
 Pa_OpenStream() framesPerBuffer parameter.
     
 @param input and @param output are either arrays of interleaved samples or;
 if non-interleaved samples were requested using the paNonInterleaved sample 
 format flag, an array of buffer pointers, one non-interleaved buffer for 
 each channel.

 The format, packing and number of channels used by the buffers are
 determined by parameters to Pa_OpenStream().
     
 @param frameCount The number of sample frames to be processed by
 the stream callback.

 @param timeInfo Timestamps indicating the ADC capture time of the first sample
 in the input buffer, the DAC output time of the first sample in the output buffer
 and the time the callback was invoked. 
 See PaStreamCallbackTimeInfo and Pa_GetStreamTime()

 @param statusFlags Flags indicating whether input and/or output buffers
 have been inserted or will be dropped to overcome underflow or overflow
 conditions.

 @param userData The value of a user supplied pointer passed to
 Pa_OpenStream() intended for storing synthesis data etc.

 @return
 The stream callback should return one of the values in the
 ::PaStreamCallbackResult enumeration. To ensure that the callback continues
 to be called, it should return paContinue (0). Either paComplete or paAbort
 can be returned to finish stream processing, after either of these values is
 returned the callback will not be called again. If paAbort is returned the
 stream will finish as soon as possible. If paComplete is returned, the stream
 will continue until all buffers generated by the callback have been played.
 This may be useful in applications such as soundfile players where a specific
 duration of output is required. However, it is not necessary to utilize this
 mechanism as Pa_StopStream(), Pa_AbortStream() or Pa_CloseStream() can also
 be used to stop the stream. The callback must always fill the entire output
 buffer irrespective of its return value.

 @see Pa_OpenStream, Pa_OpenDefaultStream

 @note With the exception of Pa_GetStreamCpuLoad() it is not permissible to call
 PortAudio API functions from within the stream callback.

/** Opens a stream for either input, output or both.
     
 @param stream The address of a PaStream pointer which will receive
 a pointer to the newly opened stream.
     
 @param inputParameters A structure that describes the input parameters used by
 the opened stream. See PaStreamParameters for a description of these parameters.
 inputParameters must be NULL for output-only streams.

 @param outputParameters A structure that describes the output parameters used by
 the opened stream. See PaStreamParameters for a description of these parameters.
 outputParameters must be NULL for input-only streams.
 
 @param sampleRate The desired sampleRate. For full-duplex streams it is the
 sample rate for both input and output
     
 @param framesPerBuffer The number of frames passed to the stream callback
 function, or the preferred block granularity for a blocking read/write stream.
 The special value paFramesPerBufferUnspecified (0) may be used to request that
 the stream callback will receive an optimal (and possibly varying) number of
 frames based on host requirements and the requested latency settings.
 Note: With some host APIs, the use of non-zero framesPerBuffer for a callback
 stream may introduce an additional layer of buffering which could introduce
 additional latency. PortAudio guarantees that the additional latency
 will be kept to the theoretical minimum however, it is strongly recommended
 that a non-zero framesPerBuffer value only be used when your algorithm
 requires a fixed number of frames per stream callback.
 
 @param streamFlags Flags which modify the behavior of the streaming process.
 This parameter may contain a combination of flags ORed together. Some flags may
 only be relevant to certain buffer formats.
     
 @param streamCallback A pointer to a client supplied function that is responsible
 for processing and filling input and output buffers. If this parameter is NULL
 the stream will be opened in 'blocking read/write' mode. In blocking mode,
 the client can receive sample data using Pa_ReadStream and write sample data
 using Pa_WriteStream, the number of samples that may be read or written
 without blocking is returned by Pa_GetStreamReadAvailable and
 Pa_GetStreamWriteAvailable respectively.

 @param userData A client supplied pointer which is passed to the stream callback
 function. It could for example, contain a pointer to instance data necessary
 for processing the audio buffers. This parameter is ignored if streamCallback
 is NULL.
     
 @return
 Upon success Pa_OpenStream() returns paNoError and places a pointer to a
 valid PaStream in the stream argument. The stream is inactive (stopped).
 If a call to Pa_OpenStream() fails, a non-zero error code is returned (see
 PaError for possible error codes) and the value of stream is invalid.
