= MinGW/MSYS =

From the [http://www.mingw.org MinGW projectpage]:

MinGW: A collection of freely available and freely distributable
Windows specific header files and import libraries, augmenting
the GNU Compiler Collection, (GCC), and its associated
tools, (GNU binutils). MinGW provides a complete Open Source
programming tool set which is suitable for the development of
native Windows programs that do not depend on any 3rd-party C
runtime DLLs.

MSYS: A Minimal SYStem providing a POSIX compatible Bourne shell
environment, with a small collection of UNIX command line
tools. Primarily developed as a means to execute the configure
scripts and Makefiles used to build Open Source software, but
also useful as a general purpose command line interface to
replace Windows cmd.exe.

MinGW provides a compiler/linker toolchain while MSYS is required
to actually run the PortAudio configure script.

Once MinGW and MSYS are installed (see the [http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki MinGW-Wiki]) open an MSYS shell and run the famous:

@code
./configure
make
make install
@endcode

The above should create a working version though you might want to
provide '--prefix=<path-to-install-dir>' to configure.

'./configure --help' gives details as to what can be tinkered with.
