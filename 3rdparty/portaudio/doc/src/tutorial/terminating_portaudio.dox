/** @page terminating_portaudio Closing a Stream and Terminating PortAudio
@ingroup tutorial

When you are done with a stream, you should close it to free up resources:

@code
    err = Pa_CloseStream( stream );
    if( err != paNoError ) goto error;
@endcode

We've already mentioned this in \ref initializing_portaudio, but in case you forgot, be sure to terminate PortAudio when you are done:

@code
    err = Pa_Terminate( );
    if( err != paNoError ) goto error;
@endcode
