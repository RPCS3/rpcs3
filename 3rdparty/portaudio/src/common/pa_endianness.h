 @brief Configure endianness symbols for the target processor.

 Arrange for either the PA_LITTLE_ENDIAN or PA_BIG_ENDIAN preprocessor symbols
 to be defined. The one that is defined reflects the endianness of the target
 platform and may be used to implement conditional compilation of byte-order
 dependent code.

 If either PA_LITTLE_ENDIAN or PA_BIG_ENDIAN is defined already, then no attempt
 is made to override that setting. This may be useful if you have a better way
 of determining the platform's endianness. The autoconf mechanism uses this for
 example.

 A PA_VALIDATE_ENDIANNESS macro is provided to compare the compile time
 and runtime endiannes and raise an assertion if they don't match.
