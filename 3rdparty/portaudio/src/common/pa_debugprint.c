 @brief Implements log function.

    PaUtil_SetLogPrintFunction can be user called to replace the provided
	DefaultLogPrint function, which writes to stderr.
	One can NOT pass var_args across compiler/dll boundaries as it is not
	"byte code/abi portable". So the technique used here is to allocate a local
	a static array, write in it, then callback the user with a pointer to its
	start.
