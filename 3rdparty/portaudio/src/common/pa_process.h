 @brief Buffer Processor prototypes. A Buffer Processor performs buffer length
 adaption, coordinates sample format conversion, and interleaves/deinterleaves
 channels.

 <h3>Overview</h3>

 The "Buffer Processor" (PaUtilBufferProcessor) manages conversion of audio
 data from host buffers to user buffers and back again. Where required, the
 buffer processor takes care of converting between host and user sample formats,
 interleaving and deinterleaving multichannel buffers, and adapting between host
 and user buffers with different lengths. The buffer processor may be used with
 full and half duplex streams, for both callback streams and blocking read/write
 streams.

 One of the important capabilities provided by the buffer processor is
 the ability to adapt between user and host buffer sizes of different lengths
 with minimum latency. Although this task is relatively easy to perform when
 the host buffer size is an integer multiple of the user buffer size, the
 problem is more complicated when this is not the case - especially for
 full-duplex callback streams. Where necessary the adaption is implemented by
 internally buffering some input and/or output data. The buffer adation
 algorithm used by the buffer processor was originally implemented by
 Stephan Letz for the ASIO version of PortAudio, and is described in his
 Callback_adaption_.pdf which is included in the distribution.

 The buffer processor performs sample conversion using the functions provided
 by pa_converters.c.

 The following sections provide an overview of how to use the buffer processor.
 Interested readers are advised to consult the host API implementations for
 examples of buffer processor usage.
 

 <h4>Initialization, resetting and termination</h4>

 When a stream is opened, the buffer processor should be initialized using
 PaUtil_InitializeBufferProcessor. This function initializes internal state
 and allocates temporary buffers as neccesary according to the supplied
 configuration parameters. Some of the parameters correspond to those requested
 by the user in their call to Pa_OpenStream(), others reflect the requirements
 of the host API implementation - they indicate host buffer sizes, formats,
 and the type of buffering which the Host API uses. The buffer processor should
 be initialized for callback streams and blocking read/write streams.

 Call PaUtil_ResetBufferProcessor to clear any sample data which is present
 in the buffer processor before starting to use it (for example when
 Pa_StartStream is called).

 When the buffer processor is no longer used call
 PaUtil_TerminateBufferProcessor.

 
 <h4>Using the buffer processor for a callback stream</h4>

 The buffer processor's role in a callback stream is to take host input buffers
 process them with the stream callback, and fill host output buffers. For a
 full duplex stream, the buffer processor handles input and output simultaneously
 due to the requirements of the minimum-latency buffer adation algorithm.

 When a host buffer becomes available, the implementation should call
 the buffer processor to process the buffer. The buffer processor calls the
 stream callback to consume and/or produce audio data as necessary. The buffer
 processor will convert sample formats, interleave/deinterleave channels,
 and slice or chunk the data to the appropriate buffer lengths according to
 the requirements of the stream callback and the host API.

 To process a host buffer (or a pair of host buffers for a full-duplex stream)
 use the following calling sequence:

 -# Call PaUtil_BeginBufferProcessing
 -# For a stream which takes input:
    - Call PaUtil_SetInputFrameCount with the number of frames in the host input
        buffer.
    - Call one of the following functions one or more times to tell the
        buffer processor about the host input buffer(s): PaUtil_SetInputChannel,
        PaUtil_SetInterleavedInputChannels, PaUtil_SetNonInterleavedInputChannel.
        Which function you call will depend on whether the host buffer(s) are
        interleaved or not.
    - If the available host data is split accross two buffers (for example a
        data range at the end of a circular buffer and another range at the
        beginning of the circular buffer), also call
        PaUtil_Set2ndInputFrameCount, PaUtil_Set2ndInputChannel,
        PaUtil_Set2ndInterleavedInputChannels,
        PaUtil_Set2ndNonInterleavedInputChannel as necessary to tell the buffer
        processor about the second buffer.
 -# For a stream which generates output:
    - Call PaUtil_SetOutputFrameCount with the number of frames in the host
        output buffer.
    - Call one of the following functions one or more times to tell the
        buffer processor about the host output buffer(s): PaUtil_SetOutputChannel,
        PaUtil_SetInterleavedOutputChannels, PaUtil_SetNonInterleavedOutputChannel.
        Which function you call will depend on whether the host buffer(s) are
        interleaved or not.
    - If the available host output buffer space is split accross two buffers
        (for example a data range at the end of a circular buffer and another
        range at the beginning of the circular buffer), call
        PaUtil_Set2ndOutputFrameCount, PaUtil_Set2ndOutputChannel,
        PaUtil_Set2ndInterleavedOutputChannels,
        PaUtil_Set2ndNonInterleavedOutputChannel as necessary to tell the buffer
        processor about the second buffer.
 -# Call PaUtil_EndBufferProcessing, this function performs the actual data
    conversion and processing.


 <h4>Using the buffer processor for a blocking read/write stream</h4>

 Blocking read/write streams use the buffer processor to convert and copy user
 output data to a host buffer, and to convert and copy host input data to
 the user's buffer. The buffer processor does not perform any buffer adaption.
 When using the buffer processor in a blocking read/write stream the input and
 output conversion are performed separately by the PaUtil_CopyInput and
 PaUtil_CopyOutput functions.

 To copy data from a host input buffer to the buffer(s) which the user supplies
 to Pa_ReadStream, use the following calling sequence.

 - Repeat the following three steps until the user buffer(s) have been filled
    with samples from the host input buffers:
     -# Call PaUtil_SetInputFrameCount with the number of frames in the host
        input buffer.
     -# Call one of the following functions one or more times to tell the
        buffer processor about the host input buffer(s): PaUtil_SetInputChannel,
        PaUtil_SetInterleavedInputChannels, PaUtil_SetNonInterleavedInputChannel.
        Which function you call will depend on whether the host buffer(s) are
        interleaved or not.
     -# Call PaUtil_CopyInput with the user buffer pointer (or a copy of the
        array of buffer pointers for a non-interleaved stream) passed to
        Pa_ReadStream, along with the number of frames in the user buffer(s).
        Be careful to pass a <i>copy</i> of the user buffer pointers to
        PaUtil_CopyInput because PaUtil_CopyInput advances the pointers to
        the start of the next region to copy.
 - PaUtil_CopyInput will not copy more data than is available in the
    host buffer(s), so the above steps need to be repeated until the user
    buffer(s) are full.

 
 To copy data to the host output buffer from the user buffers(s) supplied
 to Pa_WriteStream use the following calling sequence.

 - Repeat the following three steps until all frames from the user buffer(s)
    have been copied to the host API:
     -# Call PaUtil_SetOutputFrameCount with the number of frames in the host
        output buffer.
     -# Call one of the following functions one or more times to tell the
        buffer processor about the host output buffer(s): PaUtil_SetOutputChannel,
        PaUtil_SetInterleavedOutputChannels, PaUtil_SetNonInterleavedOutputChannel.
        Which function you call will depend on whether the host buffer(s) are
        interleaved or not.
     -# Call PaUtil_CopyOutput with the user buffer pointer (or a copy of the
        array of buffer pointers for a non-interleaved stream) passed to
        Pa_WriteStream, along with the number of frames in the user buffer(s).
        Be careful to pass a <i>copy</i> of the user buffer pointers to 
        PaUtil_CopyOutput because PaUtil_CopyOutput advances the pointers to
        the start of the next region to copy.
 - PaUtil_CopyOutput will not copy more data than fits in the host buffer(s),
    so the above steps need to be repeated until all user data is copied.

 pointers before returning.
