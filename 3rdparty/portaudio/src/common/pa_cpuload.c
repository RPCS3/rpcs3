 @brief Functions to assist in measuring the CPU utilization of a callback
 stream. Used to implement the Pa_GetStreamCpuLoad() function.

 @todo Dynamically calculate the coefficients used to smooth the CPU Load
 Measurements over time to provide a uniform characterisation of CPU Load
 independent of rate at which PaUtil_BeginCpuLoadMeasurement /
 PaUtil_EndCpuLoadMeasurement are called. see http://www.portaudio.com/trac/ticket/113
