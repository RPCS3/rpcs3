 @brief Allocation Group prototypes. An Allocation Group makes it easy to
 allocate multiple blocks of memory and free them all at once.
 
 An allocation group is useful for keeping track of multiple blocks
 of memory which are allocated at the same time (such as during initialization)
 and need to be deallocated at the same time. The allocation group maintains
 a list of allocated blocks, and can free all allocations at once. This
 can be usefull for cleaning up after a partially initialized object fails.

 The allocation group implementation is built on top of the lower
 level allocation functions defined in pa_util.h
