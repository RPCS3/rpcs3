/*Noise shaped dither  (March 2000)
-------------------

This is a simple implementation of highpass triangular-PDF dither with
2nd-order noise shaping, for use when truncating floating point audio
data to fixed point.

The noise shaping lowers the noise floor by 11dB below 5kHz (@ 44100Hz
sample rate) compared to triangular-PDF dither. The code below assumes
input data is in the range +1 to -1 and doesn't check for overloads!

To save time when generating dither for multiple channels you can do
things like this:  r3=(r1 & 0x7F)<<8; instead of calling rand() again.



  int   r1, r2;                //rectangular-PDF random numbers
  float s1, s2;                //error feedback buffers
  float s = 0.5f;              //set to 0.0f for no noise shaping
  float w = pow(2.0,bits-1);   //word length (usually bits=16)
  float wi= 1.0f/w;            
  float d = wi / RAND_MAX;     //dither amplitude (2 lsb)
  float o = wi * 0.5f;         //remove dc offset
  float in, tmp;
  int   out;


//for each sample...

  r2=r1;                               //can make HP-TRI dither by
  r1=rand();                           //subtracting previous rand()
    
  in += s * (s1 + s1 - s2);            //error feedback
  tmp = in + o + d * (float)(r1 - r2); //dc offset and dither 
  
  out = (int)(w * tmp);                //truncate downwards
  if(tmp<0.0f) out--;                  //this is faster than floor()

  s2 = s1;                            
  s1 = in - wi * (float)out;           //error

16-to-8-bit first-order dither

Type : First order error feedforward dithering code
References : Posted by Jon Watte

Notes : 
This is about as simple a dithering algorithm as you can implement, but it's
likely to sound better than just truncating to N bits.

Note that you might not want to carry forward the full difference for infinity.
It's probably likely that the worst performance hit comes from the saturation
conditionals, which can be avoided with appropriate instructions on many DSPs
and integer SIMD type instructions, or CMOV.

Last, if sound quality is paramount (such as when going from > 16 bits to 16
bits) you probably want to use a higher-order dither function found elsewhere
on this site. 


Code : 
// This code will down-convert and dither a 16-bit signed short 
// mono signal into an 8-bit unsigned char signal, using a first 
// order forward-feeding error term dither. 

#define uchar unsigned char 

void dither_one_channel_16_to_8( short * input, uchar * output, int count, int * memory ) 
{ 
  int m = *memory; 
  while( count-- > 0 ) { 
    int i = *input++; 
    i += m; 
    int j = i + 32768 - 128; 
    uchar o; 
    if( j < 0 ) { 
      o = 0; 
    } 
    else if( j > 65535 ) { 
      o = 255; 
    } 
    else { 
      o = (uchar)((j>>8)&0xff); 
    } 
    m = ((j-32768+128)-i); 
    *output++ = o; 
  } 
  *memory = m; 
}
