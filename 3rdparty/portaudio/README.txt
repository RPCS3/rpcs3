PortAudio is a portable audio I/O library designed for cross-platform
support of audio. It uses either a callback mechanism to request audio 
processing, or blocking read/write calls to buffer data between the 
native audio subsystem and the client. Audio can be processed in various 
formats, including 32 bit floating point, and will be converted to the 
native format internally.

Documentation:
	Documentation is available in "/doc/html/index.html"
	Also see "src/common/portaudio.h" for API spec.
	Also see http://www.portaudio.com/docs/
	And see the "test/" directory for many examples of usage
		(we suggest "test/patest_saw.c" for an example)
