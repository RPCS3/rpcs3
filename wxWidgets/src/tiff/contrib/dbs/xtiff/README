xtiff 2.0

xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to
handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining
simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff requires X11 R4, the Athena Widgets
and Sam Leffler's libtiff package (which can be found on ucbvax.berkeley.edu).
