Program: IPTCUTIL.C

Purpose: Convert between IPTC binary and a "special" IPTC text file format.

Usage:   iptcutil -t | -b [-i file] [-o file] <input >output

Notes:   You tell the program the "type" of input file via the -t and -b
         switches. The -t says that the input is text, while the -b says
         that the input is binary IPTC. You can use either the -i or the
         -o switches to tell the program what the input and output files
         will be, or use simple piping.

         Parts of this program were derived from other places. The original
         binary to text conversion was taken from the PHP distribution and
         the tokenizer was written many years ago, by someone else as well.
