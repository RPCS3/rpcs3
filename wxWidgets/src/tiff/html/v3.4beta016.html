<P>
This document describes the changes made to the software between the
<I>previous</I> and <I>current</I> versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.

<A NAME="configure"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>support was added for configuring the Deflate codec
<LI>support was added for the HTML documentation
<LI>codecs that are not configured for inclusion in the library
   are no longer compiled
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="libtiff"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN LIBTIFF:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>support was added for registering new codecs external to the library
   and for overriding the codecs that are builtin to the library
<LI>emulation support for the old <TT>DataType</TT> tag was improved
<LI>suppport was added for the <TT>SMinSampleValue</TT>
    and <TT>SMaxSampleValue</TT> tags
<LI>the library no longer ignores <TT>TileWidth</TT> and <TT>TileLength</TT>
    tags whose values are not a multiple of 16 (per the spec); this
    permits old, improperly written, images to be read
<LI>the support for the <TT>Predictor</TT> tag was placed in a reusable
    module so that it can be shared by multiple codecs
<LI>experimental compression support was added for the Deflate algorithm
   (using the freely available zlib package)
<LI>a new routine, <TT>TIFFWriteBufferSetup</TT> was added a la the
   routine <TT>TIFFReadBufferSetup</TT>
<LI>the DSO version of the library is now statically linked with the
   JPEG and Deflate libraries; this means applications that link against
   the DSO do not also need to link against these ancillary libraries
