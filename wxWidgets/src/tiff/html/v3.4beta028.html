This document describes the changes made to the software between the
<I>previous</I> and <I>current</I> versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.

<A NAME="configure"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>a <TT>-noninteractive</TT> flag was added to configure to
   control whether or not it prints and prompts for configuration information
<LI>various typos and fixes were made in configure for the the
   library-only build support (this and other configure fixes from
   Richard Mlynarik <A HREF=mailto:mly@adoc.xerox.com>&lt;mly@adoc.xerox.com&gt;</A>)
<LI>bugs were fixed in the handling of pathnames supplied for external
   packages; e.g. <TT>DIR_JPEG</TT>
<LI>the handling of <TT>SETMAKE</TT> is now done properly
<LI>the default prototype function declaration for <TT>pow</TT> was corrected
<LI>a bug was fixed in <B>libtiff/Makefile.in</B> that caused installation
   to fail on systems without DSO support
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="libtiff"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN LIBTIFF:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>Acorn RISC O/S support that was accidentally left out of the
   left out of the previous distribution is present (from Peter Greenham)
<LI>complaints about unknown and/or unsupported codecs have been
   delayed until they are invoked; this permits applications to open
   images and look at tags even if the image data is compressed with
   an unknown/unsupported compression scheme
<LI>bugs in handling unknown tags have been corrected; applications
   that use multiple codecs, each with codec-specific tags, no longer
   generate confusing error messages
<LI>a missing pseudo-tag definition in the CCITT G3 codec was fixed
   (this problem caused core dumps in the <TT>tiffcp</TT> program)
<LI>pseudo-tags are now treated specially; they are always considered
   to be set (i.e. they do not use bits in the <TT>FIELD_*</TT> bit-vectors).
<LI>the use of strip chopping can now be controlled on a per-file basis
   through a mode parameter supplied when opening a file (``C'' to
   enable strip chopping and ``c'' to disable)
<LI>two bugs were fixed in the writing of opposite-endian byte-order
   files
<LI>support was added for three new fax-related tags registered to
   SGI: FaxRecvParams, FaxRecvTime, and FaxSubAddress
<LI>the bit order of image data read and written can now be controlled
   on a per-file basis through a mode parameter supplied when opening
   a file (``B'' to force MSB2LSB bit order, ``L'' for LSB2MSB bit
   order, and ``H'' for the bit order of the native CPU)
<LI>the byte order of image and tag data written to newly-created files
   can now be controlled on a per-file basis through a mode parameter
   supplied when openening a file (``b'' to force Big-Endian byte order
   and ``l'' to force Little-Endian byte order)
<LI>the use memory-mapped files for images opened read-only can now
   be controlled on a per-file basis through a mode parameter supplied
   when opening a file (``M'' to enable use of memory-mapped files
   and ``m'' to disable use)
<LI>the use of the <TT>WIN32</TT> define in <B>tiffiop.h</B> has
   been replaced by <TT>__WIN32__</TT>
</UL>

<A NAME="tools"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE TOOLS:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI><TT>fax2ps</TT> now does a <TT>save</TT> and <TT>restore</TT>
    around each page of PostScript; this fixes a problem with VM
    overflow when printing a many-page document on some printers
<LI>a bug in the handling of 3-channel images by <TT>ras2tiff</TT> 
    was fixed
<LI><TT>tiffcp</TT> has new options to control the byte order of
    newly created files: <B>-B</B> for Big-Endian byte order, <B>-L</B>
    for Little-Endian byte order; a <B>-M</B> option to disable the
    use of memory-mapped files, and a <B>-C</B> option to disable the
    use of strip chopping
<LI>bugs were fixed in <TT>tiffcp</TT>'s handling of codec-specific tags
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="man"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE MANUAL PAGES:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the <TT>TIFFOpen</TT> page has been updated to reflect the new
    optional open mode parameters
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="contrib"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE:</B></A>
