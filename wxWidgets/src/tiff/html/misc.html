<H2>Acknowledgements</H2>

The libtiff software was written by Sam Leffler while working for
Silicon Graphics.<p>

The LZW algorithm is derived from the compress program (the proper attribution
is included in the source code).  The Group 3 fax stuff originated as code
from Jef Poskanzer, but has since been rewritten several times.  The latest
version uses an algorithm from Frank Cringle -- consult
<TT>libtiff/mkg3states.c</TT> and <TT>libtiff/tif_fax3.h</TT> for further
information. The JPEG support was written by Tom Lane and is dependent on the
excellent work of Tom Lane and the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) who distribute
their work under friendly licensing similar to this software. Joris Van Damme
implemented the robust Old JPEG decoder (as included in libtiff since version
3.9.0, there was another Old JPEG module in older releases, which was
incomplete and unsuitable for many existing images of that format). JBIG
module was written by Lee Howard and depends on JBIG library from the Markus
Kuhn. Many other people have by now helped with bug fixes and code; a few of
the more persistent contributors have been:
