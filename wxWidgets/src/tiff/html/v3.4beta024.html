This document describes the changes made to the software between the
<I>previous</I> and <I>current</I> versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.

<A NAME="configure"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>It is now possible to setup the software to build only the
   library; configure reconizes this is the intent when the
   <B>VERSION</B>, <B>tiff.alpha</B>, and <B>tif_version.c</B>
   files are in the local directory (i.e. ``.'')
<LI>configure no longer tries to setup HTML materials
<LI>include file directories needed in building the library are now
   specified with a <TT>DIRS_LIBINC</TT> config parameter
<LI>configure no longer checks for alternate compilers if <TT>CC</TT>
   is set; if the specified compiler is not found or is not appropriate
   the configuration procedure aborts
<LI>the <B>port.h</B> file generated by configure is now used only by
   the library and as such as have been moved to the <B>libtiff</B>
   directory
<LI>there is beginning support for building DSO's on systems other than IRIX
<LI>configure now verifies the JPEG and zlib directory pathnames by
   checking for well-known include files in these directories
<LI>configure no longer creates the <B>dist</B> directory needed only
   on SGI machines (for building SGI binary distributions)
<LI>a bug was fixed whereby configure would incorrectly set
    <TT>ENVOPTS</TT> when building the software with gcc under AIX
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="libtiff"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN LIBTIFF:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>two new typedefs were added to <B>tiff.h</TT>: <TT>int8</TT>
    and <TT>uint8</TT> for signed and unsigned 8-bit quantities,
    respectively; these are currently used only by
    programs in the <B>tools</B> directory
<LI>the <TT>BadFaxLines</TT>, <TT>CleanFaxData</TT>, and
    <TT>ConsecutiveBadFaxLines</B> tags are now supported with
    Group 4 compression
<LI>byte order is now correctly identified on 64-bit machines
<LI>a bug was fixed in the PackBits decoder where input data would
    appear short when a no-op run was present
<LI>a bug was fixed in calculations with very wide strips
<LI><TT>TIFFWriteEncodedStrip</TT> and <TT>TIFFWriteRawStrip</TT>
    were extended to support dynamically growing the number of
    strips in an image (must set <TT>ImageLength</TT> prior to
    making calls though)
<LI><TT>TIFFDefaultTileSize</TT> now rounds tile width and height
    up to a multiple of 16 pixels, as required by the TIFF 6.0 specification
<LI>the file <B>version.h</B> is now built by a new <B>mkversion</B>
    program; this was done for portability to non-UNIX systems
<LI>support was added for the Acorn RISC OS (from Peter Greenham)
<LI>the builtin codec table is now made <TT>const</TT> when compiling
    under VMS so that <B>libtiff</B> can be built as a shared library
<LI>support for the PowerPC Mac (from Ruedi Boesch)
<LI>support for Window NT/Window 95 (from Scott Wagner)
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="tools"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE TOOLS:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the tools no longer include <B>port.h</B>
<LI>various portability fixes; mostly to eliminate implicit assumptions
    about how long <TT>int32</TT> data types are
<LI>PostScript Level II additions to <TT>tiff2ps</TT> from Bjorn Brox
<LI><TT>sgi2tiff</TT> now handles RGBA images
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="man"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE MANUAL PAGES:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of
    the software
<LI>some routines have been moved to different manual pages
    to group like-routines together
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="contrib"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>support was added for the Acorn RISC OS (from Peter Greenham)
<LI>support for Windows NT/Windows 95 contributed for a previous
    version of this software was sort of incorporated (it's broken
    right now) (from Scott Wagner)
</UL>
