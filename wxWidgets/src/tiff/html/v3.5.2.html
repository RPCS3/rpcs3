<A NAME="configure"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:</B></A>

<UL>
	<LI> Corrected alpha versioning.  

	<LI> Removed distinction between  alpha and release targets in Makefile.in. 

	<LI> Added release.stamp target, which tags cvs tree, and updates 
	  "RELEASE-DATE"

	<LI> Added releasediff target, which diffs tree with source as of 
	  date in "RELEASE-DATE"
	  
	<LI>Ticked up version to 3.5.2 (alpha 01 -- but I think we'll moving 
	  away from alpha/non-alpha distinctions). 

</UL>

<A NAME="libtiff"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN LIBTIFF:</B></A>


<UL> 
        <LI> Added IRIX/gcc, and OSF/1 4.x support on behalf of 
	Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>

        <LI> Added TIFFReassignTagToIgnore() API on behalf of 
        Bruce Cameron <cameron@petris.com>.  Man page still pending.

        <LI> pre-remove so link before softlink in LINUXdso action in 
	libtiff/Makefile.in to avoid failure on LINUXdso builds other than
	the first.

        <LI> Fixed problem with cvtcmap() in tif_getimage.c modifying the
	colormaps owned by the TIFF handle itself when trying to fixup wrong
	(eight bit) colormaps.  Corrected by maintaining a private copy of
	the colormap. 

	<LI> Added TIFFReadRGBATile()/TIFFReadRGBAStrip() support in 
	tif_getimage.c.

	<LI> Applied "a" mode fix to tif_win32.c/TIFFOpen() as suggested 
	by Christopher Lawton <clawton@mathworks.com>

	<LI> Set O_BINARY for tif_unix.c open() ... used on cygwin for instance.

	<LI> Added CYGWIN case in configure.

	<LI> Applied Francois Dagand's patch to handle fax decompression bug. 
	(sizes >= 65536 were failing) 
</UL>

<A NAME="tools"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE TOOLS:</B></A>

<UL>
        <LI> Added addtiffo (add overviews to a TIFF file) in contrib.  Didn't
	    put it in tools since part of it is in C++.
</UL>
