<A NAME="configure"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>bit order was corrected for Pentium systems
<LI>a new define, <TT>HOST_BIGENDIAN</TT>, was added for code that
   wants to statically use information about native cpu byte order
</UL>

<A NAME="libtiff"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN LIBTIFF:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the G3/G4 decoder was replaced by a new one that is faster and
   has smaller state tables
<LI>Niles Ritter's client tag extension hooks were added
<LI>a new routine <TT>TIFFCurrentDirOffset</TT> was added for
   applications that want to find out the file offset of a TIFF directory
<LI>the calculation of the number of strips in an image was corected
   for images with certain esoteric configurations
<LI>a potential memory leak (very unlikely) was plugged
<LI>the <TT>TIFFReadRGBAImage</TT> support was completely rewritten
   and new, more flexible support was added for reading images into
   a fixed-format raster
<LI>YCbCr to RGB conversion done in the <TT>TIFFReadRGBAImage</TT> support
   was optimized
<LI>a bug in JPEG support calculation of strip size was corrected
<LI>the LZW decoder was changed to initialize the code table to zero
   to lessen potential problems that arise when invalid data is decoded
<LI><B>tiffcomp.h</B> is now aware of OS/2
<LI>some function prototypes in <B>tiffio.h</B> and <B>tiffiop.h</B>
   that contained parameter
   names have been changed to avoid complaints from certain compilers
</UL>

<LI>an uninitialized variable in <TT>pal2rgb</TT> has been fixed
<LI><TT>ras2tiff</TT> now converts 24-bit RGB raster data so that
   samples are written in the proper order
<LI><TT>tiff2ps</TT> has been updated to include fixes
    and enhancements from Alberto Accomazzi
<LI><TT>tiffcp</TT> now has a <TT>-o</TT> option to select a directory
    by file offset
<LI><TT>tiffinfo</TT> is now capable of displaying the raw undecoded
    image data in a file
<LI><TT>tiffgt</TT> has been rewritten to use the new <TT>TIFFRGBAImage</TT>
   support and to handle multiple files
