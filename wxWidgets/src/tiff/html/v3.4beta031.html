This document describes the changes made to the software between the
<I>previous</I> and <I>current</I> versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.

<A NAME="configure"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI><B>configure</B> now captures significantly more information
   in the <B>config.log</B> file and provides more information when
   it is unable to setup a configuration
<LI>support was added for building shared libraries on more systems:
   AIX, HPUX, Solaris, and Linux.
<LI>a new configuration parameter <TT>LIBCOPTS</TT> was added for
   passing arguments to the C compiler to use when building only
   the library; this is part of the enhanced support for building
   shared libraries
<LI>include files for optional packages that reside in <B>/usr/include</B>
   are now handled correctly
<LI>build trees may now be configured using either relative or absolute
   pathnames to the source distribution
<LI>several new configuration parameters were added, mainly for building
   shared libraries: <TT>DIST_MAJOR</TT>, <TT>DIST_MINOR</TT>, 
   <TT>DIST_ALPHA</TT>, and <TT>DSOSUF_VERSION</TT>
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="libtiff"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN LIBTIFF:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the Deflate support has been revised: it requires version 0.99 of
   the zlib software distribution, <B>the output format has changed and
   is incompatible with previous versions of this library</B> (each
   strip now includes a header read and written by the zlib library)
<LI>the codec name printed by the TIFFPrintDirectory routine is now
   taken from the codec table instead of from a builtin table; this means
   that application-defined codecs are handled correctly
<LI>a new symbol was added that contains the library version number;
   this can be used to do a compile-time compatibility check of the
   library version
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="man"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE MANUAL PAGES:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the creation and installation of manual pages was redone; it now
    implements the documented ``configuration scheme''
</UL>
