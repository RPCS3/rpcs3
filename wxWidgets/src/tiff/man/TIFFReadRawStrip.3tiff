.TH TIFFReadRawStrip 3TIFF "October 15, 1995" "libtiff"
.SH NAME
TIFFReadRawStrip \- return the undecoded contents of a strip of data from an
open
.SM TIFF
file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <tiffio.h>"
.sp
.BI "tsize_t TIFFReadRawStrip(TIFF *" tif ", tstrip_t " strip ", tdata_t " buf ", tsize_t " size ")"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read the contents of the specified strip into the (user supplied) data buffer.
Note that the value of
.I strip
is a ``raw strip number.'' That is, the caller must take into account whether
or not the data is organized in separate planes (\c
.IR PlanarConfiguration =2).
To read a full strip of data the data buffer should typically be at least as
large as the number returned by
.IR TIFFStripSize .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
The actual number of bytes of data that were placed in
.I buf
is returned;
.IR TIFFReadEncodedStrip
returns \-1 if an error was encountered.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All error messages are directed to the
.BR TIFFError (3TIFF)
routine.
