.TH GIF2TIFF 1 "November 2, 2005" "libtiff"
.SH NAME
gif2tiff \- create a
.SM TIFF
file from a GIF87 format image file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gif2tiff
[
.I options
]
.I input.gif
.I output.tif
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gif2tiff
converts a file in the GIF87 format to
.SM TIFF.
The
.SM TIFF
image is created as a palette image, with samples
compressed with the Lempel-Ziv & Welch algorithm (\c
.IR Compression =5).
These characteristics can overridden, or explicitly specified
with the options described below.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Specify a compression scheme to use when writing image data:
.B "\-c none"
for no compression,
.B "\-c packbits"
for the PackBits compression algorithm,
.B "\-c zip"
for the Deflate compression algorithm,
and
.B "\-c lzw"
for Lempel-Ziv & Welch (the default).
.TP
.B \-r
Write data with a specified number of rows per strip;
by default the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip
is approximately 8 kilobytes.
.SH NOTES
The program is based on Paul Haeberli's
.I fromgif
program which, in turn, is based on Marcel J.E. Mol's GIF reader.
.SH BUGS
Should have more options to control output format.
