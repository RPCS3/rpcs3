.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tiff2bw
converts an
.SM RGB
or Palette color
.SM TIFF
image to a greyscale image by
combining percentages of the red, green, and blue channels.
By default, output samples are created by taking
28% of the red channel, 59% of the green channel, and 11% of
the blue channel.
To alter these percentages, the
.BR \-R ,
.BR \-G ,
and
.BR \-B
options may be used.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Specify a compression scheme to use when writing image data:
.B "\-c none"
for no compression,
.B "\-c packbits"
for the PackBits compression algorithm,
.B "\-c zip
for the Deflate compression algorithm,
.B "\-c g3
for the CCITT Group 3 compression algorithm,
.B "\-c g4
for the CCITT Group 4 compression algorithm,
and
.B "\-c lzw"
for Lempel-Ziv & Welch (the default).
.TP
.B \-r
Write data with a specified number of rows per strip;
by default the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip
