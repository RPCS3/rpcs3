.TH RAS2TIFF 1 "November 2, 2005" "libtiff"
.SH NAME
ras2tiff \- create a
.SM TIFF
file from a Sun rasterfile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ras2tiff
[
.I options
]
.I input.ras
.I output.tif
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ras2tiff
converts a file in the Sun rasterfile format to
.SM TIFF.
By default, the
.SM TIFF
image is created with data samples packed (\c
.IR PlanarConfiguration =1),
compressed with the Lempel-Ziv & Welch algorithm (\c
.IR Compression =5),
and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.
These characteristics can overridden, or explicitly specified
with the options described below.
.PP
Any colormap information in the rasterfile is carried over to the
.SM TIFF
file by including a
.I Colormap
tag in the output file.
If the rasterfile has a colormap, the
.I PhotometricInterpretation
tag is set to 3 (palette);
otherwise it is set to 2 (RGB) if the depth
is 24 or 1 (min-is-black) if the depth is not 24.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Specify a compression scheme to use when writing image data:
.B "\-c none"
for no compression,
.B "\-c packbits"
for the PackBits compression algorithm,
.B "\-c jpeg"
for the baseline JPEG compression algorithm,
.B "\-c zip
for the Deflate compression algorithm,
and
.B "\-c lzw"
for Lempel-Ziv & Welch (the default).
.TP
.B \-r
Write data with a specified number of rows per strip;
by default the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip
is approximately 8 kilobytes.
.SH BUGS
Does not handle all possible rasterfiles.
In particular, 
.I ras2tiff
does not handle run-length encoded images.
