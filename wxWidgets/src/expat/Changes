Release 1.95.0 Fri Sep 29 2000
        - XML_ParserCreate_MM
                Allows you to set a memory management suite to replace the
                standard malloc,realloc, and free.
        - XML_SetReturnNSTriplet
                If you turn this feature on when namespace processing is in
                effect, then qualified, prefixed element and attribute names
                are returned as "uri|name|prefix" where '|' is whatever
                separator character is used in namespace processing.
        - Merged in features from perl-expat
                o XML_SetElementDeclHandler
                o XML_SetAttlistDeclHandler
                o XML_SetXmlDeclHandler
                o XML_SetEntityDeclHandler
                o StartDoctypeDeclHandler takes 3 additional parameters:
                        sysid, pubid, has_internal_subset
                o Many paired handler setters (like XML_SetElementHandler)
                  now have corresponding individual handler setters
                o XML_GetInputContext for getting the input context of
                  the current parse position.
        - Added reference material
        - Packaged into a distribution that builds a sharable library
