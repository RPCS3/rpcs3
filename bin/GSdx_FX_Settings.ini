//-#[ANTIALIASING TECHNIQUES]   [1=ON|0=OFF]  #READ: For best results: Use post antialiasing OR FS filtering. Not both. Postfix [2D/3D] after descriptions indicates if it's typically better for 2D, or 3D.
#define UHQ_FXAA					 0		//#High Quality Fast Approximate Anti Aliasing. Adapted for GSdx from Timothy Lottes FXAA 3.11. If using GSdx's internal FXAA, this will act as a second pass, for increased quality & coverage. [3D]
