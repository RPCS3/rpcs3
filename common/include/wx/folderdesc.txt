-------------------------------------------------
   include/wx folder -- PCSX2 Common Includes
-------------------------------------------------

This folder contains various classes borrowed from wxWidgets 2.9.x / 3.0. 

/Common/include is a PCSX2 project default include search path, and with the /wx
folder prefix, these files can be included the same way as other wxWidgets includes:

#include <wx/something.h>

If/when PCSX2 upgrades to wx2.9/3.0 these files will be removed and the wxWidgets
distribution files will automatically be used instead.

NOTE: Folder is currently empty, by design.  Nothing from 2.9/3.0 is useful anymore (for now).
