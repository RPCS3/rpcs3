// pxThread - Helper class for the basics of starting/managing persistent threads.
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This class is meant to be a helper for the typical threading model of "start once and
// reuse many times."  This class incorporates a lot of extra overhead in stopping and
// starting threads, but in turn provides most of the basic thread-safety and event-handling
// functionality needed for a threaded operation.  In practice this model is usually an
// ideal one for efficiency since Operating Systems themselves typically subscribe to a
// design where sleeping, suspending, and resuming threads is very efficient, but starting
// new threads has quite a bit of overhead.
//
// To use this as a base class for your threaded procedure, overload the following virtual
// methods:
//  void OnStart();
//  void ExecuteTaskInThread();
//  void OnCleanupInThread();
//
// Use the public methods Start() and Cancel() to start and shutdown the thread, and use
// m_sem_event internally to post/receive events for the thread (make a public accessor for
// it in your derived class if your thread utilizes the post).
//
// Notes:
//  * Constructing threads as static global vars isn't recommended since it can potentially
//    confuse w32pthreads, if the static initializers are executed out-of-order (C++ offers
//    no dependency options for ensuring correct static var initializations).  Use heap
//    allocation to create thread objects instead.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  BaseTaskThread
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// an abstract base class which provides simple parallel execution of single tasks.
//
// FIXME: This class is incomplete and untested!  Don't use, unless you want to fix it
// while you're at it. :D
//
// Implementation:
//   To use this class your derived class will need to implement its own Task() function
//   and also a "StartTask( parameters )" function which suits the need of your task, along
//   with any local variables your task needs to do its job.  You may additionally want to
//   implement a "GetResult()" function, which would be a combination of WaitForResult()
//   and a return value of the computational result.
//
// Thread Safety:
//   If operating on local variables, you must execute WaitForResult() before leaving the
//   variable scope -- or alternatively have your StartTask() implementation make full
//   copies of dependent data.  Also, by default PostTask() always assumes the previous
//   task has completed.  If your system can post a new task before the previous one has
//   completed, then it needs to explicitly call WaitForResult() or provide a mechanism
//   to cancel the previous task (which is probably more work than it's worth).
//
// Performance notes:
//  * Remember that thread creation is generally slow, so you should make your object
//    instance once early and then feed it tasks repeatedly over the course of program
//    execution.
//
//  * For threading to be a successful speedup, the task being performed should be as lock
//    free as possible.  For example using STL containers in parallel usually fails to
//    yield any speedup due to the gratuitous amount of locking that the STL performs
//    internally.
//
//  * The best application of tasking threads is to divide a large loop over a linear array
//    into smaller sections.  For example, if you have 20,000 items to process, the task
//    can be divided into two threads of 10,000 items each.
