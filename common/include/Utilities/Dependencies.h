//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// DeclareNoncopyableObject
// This macro provides an easy and clean method for ensuring objects are not copyable.
// Simply add the macro to the head or tail of your class declaration, and attempts to
// copy the class will give you a moderately obtuse compiler error that will have you
// scratching your head for 20 mintes.
//
// (... but that's probably better than having a weird invalid object copy having you
//  scratch your head for a day).
//
// Programmer's notes:
//  * We intentionally do NOT provide implementations for these methods, which should
//    never be referenced anyway.

//  * I've opted for macro form over multi-inherited class form (Boost style), because
//    the errors generated by the macro are considerably less voodoo.  The Boost-style
//    The macro reports the exact class that causes the copy failure, while Boost's class
//    approach just reports an error in whatever "NoncopyableObject" is inherited.
//
//  * This macro is the same as wxWidgets' DECLARE_NO_COPY_CLASS macro.  This one is free
//    of wx dependencies though, and has a nicer typeset. :)

// Base class used to implement type-safe sealed classes.

// all sealed classes derive from a unique BaseSealed (preventing them from accidentally
// circumventing sealing by inheriting from multiple sealed classes.
